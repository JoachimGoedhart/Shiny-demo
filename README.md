# Shiny-demo

Step-by-step instructions for building a Shiny app, startimg with a histogram that shows a distribution of 'waiting times' from the geyser dataset. The start is the "master" branch and is identical to the 'app' that is created when a new Shiny app is generated from R/Rstudio.
Changes and new features are added and can be followed by selecting new branches (Update_1, Update_2 and so forth).

To run the different Updates from R/Rstudio use:
shiny::runGitHub('Shiny-demo', 'JoachimGoedhart', ref="Update_1")
shiny::runGitHub('Shiny-demo', 'JoachimGoedhart', ref="Update_2")
......and so on.....
